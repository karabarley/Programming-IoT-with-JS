# Programming IoT with Javascript

One of the fun events we host at HackerYou is a weekly show and tell where our students pick a topic to present for 5 minutes to classmates, instructors and alumni.

For my show & tell, I picked a topic really interests me - the Internet of Things. For my demonstration, I was able to show the audience how to use javascript (node.js) and the command line to program a TP-LNIK smart light bulb to turn on/ off and change colours -- thanks to the documetation found online https://github.com/konsumer.

You may find my script, presentation deck and demonstration code along (with plenty comments) attached here for your reference.
